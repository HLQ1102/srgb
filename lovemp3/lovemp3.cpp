/*
Shine Dion是来自挪威Skien(斯基恩)的2重唱组合，它的音乐被认为是挪威和爱尔兰民调的结合体,在音乐中经常使用很多乐器：小提琴、风笛、SAX、曼陀林(类似我们的琵琶)、3角铁、美乐特朗(电子琴)、木吉他。其中Janne Hansen是主唱兼歌词创作，Per Selör则主作曲和吉他弹奏。 歌曲的歌词灵感通常都是来自挪威当地的神话，传说及风土人情，他们的音乐成功实现了古典和现代的结合，从中我们可以感受到田园般的宁静，灵魂的脆弱，及时间的无涯。

歌词：
By an old drinking well
On the grass so green
古井幽幽 绿草青青
I lay down and fell into a dream
在水之湄，傍井而眠
By a strange mellow sound
From a silver eyed bird
梦里依稀 白鸟飞过
其声如磁 对吾轻鸣
I opened me eyes but said no word
轻启双眸，四处寂静
On the pathway came walking
A woman so bold
蓦然回首 村妇而过
Behind her in silence went the old
背影萧瑟 沧沧桑桑
Ahead ran the children
四野之中
With joyful cries
孩提烂漫
Their faces were lifted to the skies
天空之中
尽情回响
The woman’s hair was raven
发如墨
And black as the night
墨如夜
Covered with stars shining bright
星光暗淡
As they passed by the well
漫漫而去
I saw that their eyes
Were flaming like many coloured ice
眼神冰冷 热情而结
They passed by the well
漫漫而过
Like a breeze pure and clean
清风浮过
Soon they were nowhere to be seen
其影隐没
When I woke up alone
独自醒来
On the grass so green
芳草青青
I looked into the well to catch the dream
倚井而视 梦影依稀
The water was rising
清水微升
And I felt a chill
凉意袭来
I willed the water to be still
水光如镜
There was a face in the mirror
与己而视
And the face out of time
韶华已逝
The eyes held a shimmering shine
眼眸清亮
There was a face in the mirror
与己而视
Like a face wasn’t mine
不曾相识
The eyes held a shimmering shine
蓦然回首
脉脉离去
